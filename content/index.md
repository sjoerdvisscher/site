## Who?

This project is developed by the [Statebox](https://statebox.org) team.

## What?

Typedefs is a programming language agnostic, algebraic data type definition language, written in [Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org/).

Current backends are Haskell, ReasonML and JSON Schema, see [targets](/targets) for details.

</span>

## Why?

Existing tools ([protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/), [thrift](https://thrift.apache.org)) lack algebraic structure and may cause friction when used in more principled settings such as *proof assistants* or *purely functional programming languages*.

An overview and motivation can be found on the [about](/about) page.

## When?

This project is close to being usable, we are working hard on documentation, tooling and target language support.

In the long term, we envision a content addressable repository of types, usable in all programming languages and beyond.
